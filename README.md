# Project 2
Custom Portrait & Landscape Orders - Manar Essam 
Project Overview:
Manar Art is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of commissioning custom artwork. Users can browse a gallery of available paintings or request custom portraits with their own reference images. The platform allows customers to place orders, specify delivery details, and make secure payments. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while the frontend is a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface.
Key Features:
‚Ä¢	Gallery & Custom Orders: Users can choose from pre-made gallery items or request custom artwork with specific sizes and reference photos.
‚Ä¢	Order Management: Customers can provide their details, select a delivery date, and choose a payment method (credit card, Vodafone Cash, or PayPal).
‚Ä¢	File Uploads: Users can upload reference photos for custom orders, with validation for file type and size.
‚Ä¢	Order Tracking: Orders are stored in a MongoDB database, with status updates (pending, in-progress, completed, cancelled).
‚Ä¢	Responsive Design: The frontend is designed to work seamlessly across devices.
Tech Stack:
‚Ä¢	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
‚Ä¢	Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
‚Ä¢	File Handling: Multer for file uploads
‚Ä¢	Validation: Custom middleware for order data validation
‚Ä¢	Security: Environment variables for sensitive data, CORS configuration, and rate limiting
How It Works:
1.	Users browse the gallery or request custom artwork.
2.	They fill out an order form with their details, delivery date, and payment method.
3.	The backend processes the order, calculates pricing, and stores it in the database.
4.	Users receive confirmation and can track their order status.
Why This Project?
This project demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack application with a focus on user experience, data validation, and secure file handling. It showcases my skills in backend development, database management, and frontend design.
